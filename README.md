# Artificial-Intelligence

The purpose of this project is to create a A.G.I. (Artificial General Intelligence) System that can dynamically generate a network based upon a text input using a RNN which can receive a text based input or from a image or video input from a CNN or an audio based Neural Network.
The main system runs from the Core class which can have 16 more of itself in order to handle any excess data and it can have 16 AI's in order to process the data. These Core's and AI's have their own ID so they can be identified by the Core - that it belongs to - if it needs to be shut down for the purpose of efficiency or any other reason.
